# Wordle Replica

### Introduction

This browser game is inspired by the web game "Wordle". The aim of the game is to guess a mystery five-letter word, known as the “wordle” in six tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to reflect how close your guess was to the word. For example, if a tile turns green, that means that letter is in the word and in the correct spot. If a tile turns yellow, it is in the word, but not in the correct spot

This project was completed as a part of NC State's [software development bootcamp](https://digitalskills.continuingeducation.ncsu.edu/catalogs/software-development.pdf). This project was an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and therefore provided a good challenge given the time constraint (1 week). As this was an introduction to web development, much was learned in the sphere of web architecture, and structure, including working with the DOM, JavaScript mutations, and a general knowledge of HTML's relationship with CSS.
